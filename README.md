# loan_amount

## Introduction

Here, we can reformulate the given problem as regression problem. Our goal is to build a regressor model that can predict the loan_amount from the given features for the given structured (tabular) data. To achieve this, first, we need to do the data analysis and data cleaning, data preparation for training, and then model building. After this, based on the performance of the model and to get the expected result, we need to change the model and sometimes it may require data analysis and data pre-processing again.
